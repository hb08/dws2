                <p> Associated Press</p>

                <p>A young brunette appeared before the recently bombed Seattle headquarters of Peace with Powers, a small group of meta humans that preach non-violence.  "The Guild of Killers issued a statement regarding the capture of several of their members by the Minor League last month, purportedly issued by the group's enigmatic leader, Wound-Maker.  'We are not defined by the weak, the sloppy, and the inexperienced.  The Guild is strong and unstoppable.  Metas have been warned.  There is no place for you in this new world so come, let us usher you into the next.'  No response has been made by the metahuman community.  It leads this reporter to wonder, where is the Freedom League when we need them most?</p>

                <p>The three villains who participated in the attack on metahuman Thomas Higgens, known to the public as Bear-Knuckles, Recall, and Elite, as well as the unnamed lackeys that worked in conjunction with them, have all been remanded to federal custody, and will be held at Blackstone until it's decided whether they'll face a normal trial or a military tribunal, since they were acting as members of a terrorist organization.  If not for the intercession of the so-called 'Junior League', things could have been far worse, something acknowledged by the police and a number of groups who are currently voicing the rising tide of pro-meta sentiment in Freedom City, despite the rise of anti-metaism elsewheres.</p>

                <p> Freedom Ledger</p>

                <p>Based on one of our most recent polls, 97% of readers thought that there should be no criminal charges filed in the case of international model and adopted Freedonian Nan Lova, who bravely faced down and accidentally killed the villain known as Dr. Stratos, aka Sebastian Stratos, during an attempted rape when he'd kidnapped her.  Freedom Ledger Online Forum comments were almost universally supportive, from "I wish you'd saved more for us!" by fozziebear, to, "She deserves a medal, not any kind of charges.  She's one of the Lord's special angels," from moarchrist4u.</p>

                <p> Christian Science Monitor</p>

                <p>The notorious anti-meta blogger and activist James Castle, who somehow managed to acquire inside information on the identities of a number of different metahuman vigilantes, was rushed to the Freedom Hospital West Campus, where he remains in the intensive care unit after suffering burns that cover almost fifty percent of his body.  He was found inside of his garage, and the act appeared to be self-inflicted, as there was no evidence of any other sort of assault on Mr. Castle, nor was there any means of accessing the locked garage, although the FCPD said they are still investigating potential leads.  Reactions to pro-meta legislation among the hate group's membership have become more violent recently, with two members of the Boise, Idaho branch facing charges of dragging a nineteen year old mutant girl with phosphorescent skin behind a truck and calling it 'glowstick pulling'.</p>

                <p>Three people were killed and fourteen taken to the hospital when Meta NO! and Power Pride hosted events in Houston on Saturday.  Police on scene were forced to use tear gas and fire hoses to break up the inevitable riot.  What Houston city officials were thinking allowing both events to be planned at the same time remains a mystery.  Among the dead was 15 year old Jennifer Richards, whose own meta-powers seemed to have been triggered at the event.  Jennifer was marching with Meta NO! when she started glowing violet and beams of energy shot from her fingertips.  She was attacked by her fellow marchers and died as she tried to flee.</p>

                <p>In an outstanding show of support, during the recent tragic rampage in California, local metahumans gathered to protect the local schools and hospitals. Said one volunteer, who wished to be unnamed, "We all have to pull together. Hell, last week some meta-haters tried to beat me up in the park, but I'm not going to let that make me hate all people that aren't metas. Especially not the kiddos. They haven't done nothin' to nobody. [...] My power? Oh yeah, I talk to ducks. See those guys over there? That'd be my army. It may not be much, but if a flock of ducks flying your way isn't enough of a distraction to save a kid or two, then I don't know what is. Like I said, we all have to pull together."</p>

No-one was seen entering or exiting the building before the incident, and none of the staff or visitors present have been charged for the crime.  More information will be reported as the situation develops.</p>

                <p>More excitement on the metahuman front. The Alternateens have already found a place in the heart of Freedom City. Sister Chaste, EbonKnight, Wilderness Girl, Demo, Feather, and Brick have all been a force in the battle of good and evil so often fought on our city streets. Bursting into the cape scene as they rescued key city officials from a terrorist attack on a cruse dinner, they haven't slowed down since. Their more notable accomplishments including the capture of 4, 7, and 8 of the Power Corps; Angst; Mr. Lucky; and preventing an attack on ASTRO Labs conducted by the newest Fear Master. The Alternateens have given much to our beloved city, and have come forward with a request to help. "While we have given all that we can to our beloved city," Sister Chaste revealed in an exclusive interview with Channel 5 News, "we must, as all heroes do, admit to our own faults. We are but six against the rising tide of those who wish nothing but harm on the innocent. It is for that reason we feel the need to appeal to those we cherish the most. People of Freedom City, we request help in our battle. Not from those who are unable to fight, but rather from those who possess the powers, will, and values we hold so dearly. We are seeking two new members to our family of Freedom fighters." Demo was quick to add, "But don't call us, we'll call you!"</p>         </article>

                <p>Tragedy struck in Grenville today. A family of five was discovered dead in their home. Police believe it to be murder suicide, with strong evidence pointing to Thomas De Moion, patriarch of the family, as the culprit. Neighbors are stunned. "They were going on vacation. I think Jerusalem or something, since they said they were celebrating the holiday," one neighbor said. "We thought they were gone." The house had seemed empty from the outside since September 25th, but the family, Thomas, his son Daniel and wife Chaya, along with their twin six-year-old daughters, Nava and Tova, were being held hostage by an increasingly violent Thomas. "The house was boarded up from the inside," one FCPD investigator revealed, "They were trapped in the basement. We have reason to believe Thomas and Daniel were working in concert to keep Chaya, Nava, and Tova hidden in the basement." The sound of screams from the seemingly empty home alerted neighbor and good Samaritan, Dejan LaBelle, that something wasn't right. "I went to check on the house, and when I reached the front door, the screaming had stopped. I pounded on it, and shouted for my wife to call 911. All I could think about were those little girls. They used to play with my boys, so I knew I had to do something. I kicked the door in, and... I dunno. It was real crazy in there. There was writing on the walls, like some Helter Skelter stuff. Weird words, like Shoah, Hurban, and one wall was just covered with 'Never Again' over and over and over. I felt like I was in one of those Criminal Minds episodes or something. I wanted to leave, but I couldn't. I kept thinking if those girls were the ones screaming... so I went further in, the door to the basement was open and... oh man. I really wish I hadn't gone down there. I just... I wish I hadn't at all.</p>

Thought to be a 'bogeyman' of sorts by the police in the area, the folk-hero called Nobody has gained a rising popularity amongst the impoverished (Rowe, 2011).

                <p>At least 23 students were injured, with 14 in critical care, in a violent spree on Freedom College Campus today. Accounting student, Kenneth Allen, allegedly began attacking students in his Business and Professional Ethics for Accountants class. "He just went crazy," a fellow student, who witnessed the violence, claims. "We were listening to the professor in lecture, and the screaming started. I didn't know what was going on." Allen, according to other eyewitness reports, recieved no provocation to the attack. Utilizing impromptu weapons, the Freedom College student went on a rampage that escalated in violence until the teaching assistant and Freedom City native, Christopher Beck, managed to subdue him. While Beck has yet to make a statement, Natasha Harding was quick to speak on his bravery. "Kenneth was wild. He stabbed Robbie in the neck with a pen, then attacked Professor Fishman with a pair of scissors from his desk. He stabbed him over and over again, and ran out of the room. Chris, he was really calm the whole time. He told Bruce to call 911, then got Stanley and Debra to help the people already hurt. I don't know how he remembered, but Stanley's an Eagle Scout, and Debra is a volunteer firefighter, so he knew they'd be able to. Then he told me to lock the door, that he was going after Kenneth to stop him before he hurt anyone else or himself." By the time Beck was able to stop Kenneth's rampage down the halls, 21 more people had been injured. Witnesses claim Beck spoke to Allen, distracting the crazed boy before tackling him to the ground and pinning him in a high school wrestling move known as 'Double Wrist Lock' until police arrived to the scene and subdue the suspect.</p>

                <p>Doc Otaku took the internet by storm on October 13th, known to some as "Face Your Fears" Day. In a video released on Youtube, titled "Midnight My Love", Doc Otaku confessed, once again, his undying love for the Minor League member Midnight, and revealed his latest robot, an android modeled after Midnight. Following a bevy of comments, he quickly released a second video entitled "Midnight is a GIRL!" in which he tried to prove that the masked crusader was female. Under another assault of comments, he added a third video, "Not All Robots are Sex Robots", in which he vowed to remain chaste in all "physical, emotional, robotic, and mechanical" ways, until he won the heart of Midnight. Midnight has yet to respond to any of the three videos, and the internet community seems divided on what the true gender of the costumed crime fighter is, as well as the ethnic heritage, of which Doc Otaku claims to have irrevocable yet private proof is Japanese.</p>

In the first ceremony of its kind, Officiants Itou Yamato and Bella Rosenthal re-enacted the now iconic wedding scene from the anime "Sharpe: Ame Futte Chi Katamaru" for over 300 couples dressed as the characters Sharpe (current real life member of the Minor League) and the reincarnation of Tomoe Gozen, (currently a real life member of FORCE-Ops), (called Utsukushii in the Anime after protests that Atlanta was a far too forgien name, and brought only images of an American city when trying to find pictures online). "They are easily the most romantic couple on television," exclaimed one glowing bride as she waited in the three hour long line for her ceremony. "I can't imagine anything more exciting, or a better way to start the marriage, than to recreate a wedding between the most noble of heroes, and the most beautiful of women," a soon-to-be groom beamed. As for Itou and Rosenthal, their website explains how the ceremony will be preformed, "Passion, love, and a harmonious relationship are to be desired. Feel your pulse quicken as you see your beloved. Watch in anticipatory (sic) as he must fight his way through wave after wave of hostile enemies to meet his bride. Together they must battle those who hold doubts before binding to one another for eternity."</p>

The truck driver and his passenger sustained minor injuries. Based upon eye-witness reports and the modifications to the car involved in the accident, it's possible that the wreck could have been involved in illegal underground street racing, as several people in the area witnessed an older-model red sports car fleeing the scene at high speeds.

Most law commentators have called the charges 'farcical' and 'ridiculous', with attorney Gloria Allred releasing a statement that, "She (Allred) will defend, with all the vigor possible, Ms. Lova in any court of law pro-bono, and that she expects the charges to be thrown out as videotaped evidence clearly shows that Ms. Lova was acting in self defense." In the words of retired superhero Lightning Burst, "the girl deserves an (expletive deleted) medal, not to go to trial." No word yet on when the hearing will be scheduled. </p>

The man, still unidentified, was found in an early state of decomposition by a local business owner who wished to remain unidentified, and based on preliminary coroner's reports, had been partially eaten, apparently by one or more human suspects. Several open packages of "Cloud 9" variety bath salts as well as a small acrylic pipe were located among the victim's belongings, as well as scattered about the area. Police still have no leads as to any possible suspects or any other motive in the slaying.

Neighbors and those who knew the couple have all been shocked, with Benjamin Prewett, a former foster-child of the Rodriguezes, quoted as saying, "I just can't believe something like this could happen to them. I mean, they've always wanted to adopt, and the paperwork just went through... I mean, I'm in shock! They were my parents until I got out of the system, and I... I was supposed to go over next week for Friday dinner." All of the doors and windows to the home were locked, and there were no signs of forced entry. Police Deputy Alphonse Meyers spoke briefly on the record with our investigative reporter. "I ain't never seen nothing that horrible before. There was just blood, just everywhere. There ain't no way a little girl could do nothin' like that ..." before refusing to give any further information. Police have refused to categorize the crime as foul play until a complete investigation has been completed. Further updates to follow as new information is received. </p>

                <p> In an unprecedented attack on an institution of healing, Snyder Memorial Hospital has been brought to its knees by a dual attack by The Guild of Killers, led by none other than WoundMaker, and thief and murderer ShadowThief. </p>
                <p> Police do not yet know if the attack was cooperative or simply a coincidence, but footage from the crime scene clearly shows ShadowThief attacking WoundMaker only moments before the leader of The Guild knocked out the electricity in the wing his protege, Elite, was recovering from the brutal takedown by Minor League member, Vassal, which resulted in 2nd and 3rd degree burns over 30% of Elite's body. </p>
                <p>To only complicate matters, during the fray, police believe that Power Right, an organization that believes metahumans and those humans capable of keeping pace with them are the natural evolution of humanity, used the ruckus to break Elite out. He is believed to have escaped with the help of Metamorph, a member of the Power Right that utilizes the ability to change personal appearance and the appearances of others. Elite's whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>

                <p> CNN </p>

                <p> In light of the escape of Elite, second in line to the Guild of Killers, Senator Edward Bergen has begun advocating the until now ignored legislation S.3124. The proposed legislation, called Justice For All by proponents of the bill, calls for action against 'Metahumans and Metahuman Affiliates'. This law, if passed, will declare all of those classified under those terms exempt from trial by jury, to be held in a metahuman correctional facility from arrest through trial, and expedited trials.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p>  Fox News </p>

                <p>Our guest tonight is Senator Bergen. Thank you for agreeing to an interview tonight. As we all know, in light of the damages to Snyder Memorial Hospital in the breakout of accused murder, Elite, the Senator has proposed a bill that, to be frank, we find completely against the American way. Senator Bergen, just how do you justify the creation of a second class citizen, through the passing of this bill?" </p>
                <p>"With all due respect, it is preposterous to believe that metahumans and their affiliates are on equal footing with the rest of the citizens of United States. They facts are simple. This particular grouping has a 30% higher incident of avoiding trial by utilizing their particular talents or abilities to escape police custody or disappear completely. They are 60% more likely to break out of normal prisons. While I could never, in good conscious, treat a suspect as guilty until proven innocent, metahumans and their affiliates are bypassing the judicial system by using their above human abilities. Rather than creating a second class of those who must face the accusations of the law, metahumans and affiliates have created a God-like status in a nation of the God-fearing. This leads me to one of the most important aspects of the bill, the exception from trial by jury. A jury, if we are to follow the intent of the Constitution, should be created from a pool of peers. If we are up in arms over an all white jury for an African American, or Latino suspect, or if we become upset over an all male jury for a female accused of crimes, how can we in good conscience have a trial of metahumans and affiliates by those who do not hold the innate abilities or learned skills of such? The humans that choose to walk beside metahumans are not the same as you and I. They have dedicated their entire lives to an ideal or acquisition of a skillset at the sacrifice of the core essence that is cultivated and prized in the rest of humanity. To ask that a jury of the average citizens be asked to pass judgment on a sect of people that they have no understanding of... well, in my eyes it would be tantamount to the same injustice as having an all male Caucasian jury of the alleged 1% on a case with charges being pressed against an African American who has lived all 18 years of his life under the poverty line in the MacArthur Area of my native home in LA." </p>

                <p>Members of the MetAnon, one of the more vocal proponents of Metahuman Equality, have a proposed answer to the "Justice For All" bill. Lindsay Shiffrin, founder of MetAnon stated, "The clear intent of this bill is to create a second-class citizen with the metahuman amongst us. What we propose is a meeting in the middle. Justice should be enacted across the board, no matter what genetic gifts or curses a person has. The issue of trial by jury is one we have often held in question. We believe through a simple registration of metahumans, with all records being kept confidential to the public, we can instead have a pool of jury members, peers to the metahumans on trial, that can be called upon during trial. On the topic of having an expedited trial for metahumans alone... we find that a true abomination. Trials, according to the very founders of this nation, should be conducted as quickly as possible. Instead of asking for expedited trials for metahumans alone, we ask instead why all Americans should not have that right. As for locking away suspects through the duration of trial, unless this applied across the board, with all Americans, it cannot be considered justice. We of MetAnon do not ask that metahumans be treated as special or different, but instead that laws apply to all Americans, regardless of genetic inheritance or differences." </p>

                <p> Fresh Water Co. has finally made a statement on allegations that a metahuman employee was responsible for the purification of their water. The employee, Madeline Nicolai, has the ability to purify water beyond the capabilities of any known process. Fresh Water has admitted to not only using her abilities, but solely relying upon them in production. In a statement released today, Fresh Water stands not only by their initial decision to do so, but have promised to continue to do so.</p>
                <p> "We thought long and hard before employing Madeline Nicolai, and we could find no injustice in the act. Not only has employing her cut down our production costs significantly, but we stand by our right to not only employ but utilize the abilities of a metahuman. We believe that it is not a flaw in our company, but rather a flaw in the culture we live in, that doing so has caused such a crisis. The stage of production in which Ms. Nicolai has been included usually requires only one employee to oversee the machines used. Not only has employing her allowed the addition of 25,000 employees to the company to keep up with her output of products, but it has also allowed us to pass the tests conducted by the FDA and EPA, and also every single testing facility in our nation with flying colors. We have consistently surpassed every other bottled water company in taste tests, consumption rates, as well as in lessening of environmental impacts. We move forward, continuing our employment of Ms. Nicolai, with full faith in the American people to not cast judgment on us for treating Ms. Nicolai as we would any other potential employee, by assessing her abilities and placing her in a position where she can use them to not only help the company but also to earn a paycheck, whether it be purifying water, crunching numbers, or greeting our customers with a smile."</p>

                <p> Televised Statement of Janice Armstrong, of the MetAlliance </p>

                <p>We are a nation in crisis, and the answer to many of our problems is held within our very citizens. We can no longer sit idly by, pretending that metahumans only exist to perpetrate or fight crime. As the metahuman population is rising, we must enact registration, not, as detractors have claimed, to place stars on the lapels of our populace, but rather to validate a very important component of society. Metahumans should not feel the need to hide their abilities, nor should they feel superior. Only by accepting them as our brethren, and giving them appropriate channels through which to use their powers, will we fully be able to embrace the metahuman phenomena. It is for this reason, we suggest registration. A voluntary registration, in exchange for the government offering job location assistance. Together we can work with metahumans to help society on a whole.
                </p>
                <p>During Hurricane Katrina, there was an outpouring of help from all areas of the United States, and yet we never heard of the metahumans that offered assistance.  </p>
                <p>January Stevens, a metahuman capable of restoring items to pristine condition through touch, spent three months on New Orleans, restoring damaged homes. When she returned to her home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, she had lost her job as a waitress, and later her apartment when her job search proved to be in vain.  </p>
                <p>Tom Anderson, a metahuman with water control abilities, protected 10 city blocks from the oncoming rush of water during evacuation proceedings. He lost his life while attempting to hold the waters at bay, and while the entire area was evacuated, down to the last person and household pet, he has not been named as a hero. </p>
                <p>Dominique and Dakota Williams, metahumans who shared the ability to heal others with a touch while in 20 foot proximity to one another, tended to the refugees trapped on the bridge. These twins received no praise, no reward, but instead were separated when help finally arrived and sent to orphanages on opposite sides of the nation, despite please to stay together and stay in the area to offer further assistance.  </p>
                <p>Monica Hernandez, a metahuman with the ability to locate missing people was refused access to New Orleans during the aftermath, because she was in the United States on a student visa.  </p>
                <p>Valerie and Justin Miller, married metahumans with the abilities of telekinesis and superspeed respectively, rebuilt on average one home per week during their six month stay. In return, they lost their jobs. Once an accountant and a teacher, they both now work two part time jobs to make ends meet.  </p>
                <p>How many other, unsung heroes were there in our time of need? How many more could there have been, had we only extended an offer?  </p>
                <p>We are all familiar with the 'heroes', Captain Thunder, Lady Liberty, The Atom Family, and Lightening Joe. Our question to America is, why do heroes have to wear masks and capes? Why do we only respect full time heroes? Why do we not allow those amongst us with the abilities to help others in a specific time of need to step forth and do so, without suffering economic retribution?  </p>
                <p>It is with those questions in mind that we have drafted our proposition. A voluntary and confidential registration. Those who register are free to volunteer their services, or voluntarily agree to requests made by the government to help. We are not asking for metahumans to become a slave force, or to be drafted. In fact, we vehemently oppose such inhumane acts. Instead, we ask that the government not only look to our metahuman brethren for help, but also help them in return. Those called upon in a time of need should be offered wages high enough to allow them a home to return to. They should be given a guarantee that the jobs they have will accept them back, once they have assisted as much as they feel they can. The sooner we are able to offer that type of security, the sooner we will be able to face the force of a hurricane, tropical storm, earthquake, or terrorist attack and know with full certainty that not only will we rise above it, but we can save the lives of those who would be lost, and preserve a lifestyle for all those who help, and all those who need it." </p>

            <p>About fifty miles upstream from the river that fueled the main water supply of Freedom City, a small and pearlescent nodule, once buried beneath enough layers of dirt the weight alone should have long ago crushed such a seemingly delicate object, wriggled, the journey's end finally arriving, as it pushed through the surface. As it finally ceased it's perpetual upward motion, however slow, the nodule waited...and waited... and waited.</p>

            <p>When the small biological clock deep inside began to ring, it burst open on a night where the silver rays of the moon, diffused into an equally silver glow beneath the water's surface, caught the sparkling mote cloud of seeds from the now empty shell. Carried with the current, the motes disappeared from sight as the only cloud in the sky covered the moon.</p>

            <p>It was obviously nighttime, judging by the pale radiance that shone down and nearly illuminated the entirety of the strange suburban block. It looked like a portion of Freedom City, but unfamiliar, as if it's features had shifted enough to be nearly unrecognizable. Three massive manor houses stood before him, but the whole of the block that he was on was eerily silent, not even the buzzing of insects or the noise of animals present.</p>

            <p>The first residence had it's palatial front doors wide open, and as he stepped inside, there were signs of a struggle in the foyer with a vase shattered, it's wet contents scattered about the floor. A trail of dried bloodstains led into a sitting room, but when he got inside, there was nothing there; no pool of blood, no furniture, no decorations. Only the large square panes of soft light from the outside. The whole house was much the same, and as he exited through the door to the backyard, he suddenly found himself at the next house down the block, it's front bathed in the same omnipresent light.</p>

            <p>The other two houses on the block had been similarly sinister; abandoned, down to the absence of mouse droppings or spiderwebs, it was as if their inhabitants had suddenly disappeared, vanishing into thin air, never to return. When he'd left the third and final building, he found himself on the blacktop of the street between them, walking towards the end of the block as the night was lit nearly as bright as day, the moon's rays almost like sunlight, causing him to squint. It was what he saw as he passed the mailboxes that brought his heart to a near still. The names Driogano, Tonifanni, and Oliverti.</p>

            <p>Then, there was sunlight, as the Venetian blinds in the office room failed to block out the day's angry rays. The repeating tone of an instant messenger's typing field that had seen it's end reached chimed as blond, long hair was pushed out of the way of a pair of eyes that immediately looked around for a telephone. He wasn't certain what it meant, but it couldn't be good.</p>

            <p>Jacob Miller was a powerful man. 6'4" and 210lbs of muscles. Able to keep pace with even the fittest and newest of recruits from the academy, even at 46. He held the highest-ranking position of anyone in law enforcement in the city. Yet, while he sat behind his desk, in the corner office so many men were striving to reach, he felt completely powerless. His daughter was missing.  The entire police force, adoptive family to the girl, were searching for her. Criminals had been tapped from the crime lords, to the mob bosses, down to petty thieves and hookers. No one had seen her. No one could find her.</p>

            <p>The door to his office cracked open, and his head snapped up, the lines in his face not there the morning before a dark roadmap of his unhappiness. His features lightened. "Did they- What are you doing here?" Concern hit his voice, and his expression was startled as he spotted the glint of metal in a familiar hand. "Wh-" any further questions were cut off as the gunshot echoed through his office and the station. His hand went up to his chest before he registered what had happened. His ears were ringing, and warmth was bubbling over his hand, thick and hot. He looked down at the blood pouring out of the bullet wound.</p>

            <p>Footsteps pounded down the hallway, too far away to stop this. Too far away to help. The shadows of the room were closing in around him, and he stared up at the moon through his window before his eyes finally closed.</p>
