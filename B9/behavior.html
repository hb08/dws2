                </header>
                <p>Bunnies have a language all of their own. As prey animals, their instincts and actions can be incredibly confusing to us humans. By learning about their <a href="#bodylanguage">body language</a>, <a href="#noises">noises</a> or lack thereof, and specific <a href="#action">actions</a>, we can certainly start communicating with our fuzzie little friends.</p>

            <h2>Body Language</h2>
            <section class="medium-12 columns">
                <p>Bunny body language can be one of the most difficult things for new owners to learn. They are naturally prey animals, so their actions can be counter-intuitive to what we, as humans, would do and what we are familiar with when it comes to other household pets like dogs and cats.</p>

            <h3>Biting and Chewing</h3>
            <section class="medium-12 columns">
                <p class="center">A lot of rabbit communication comes through nips, bites, and nibbles.</p>
                <aside class="note medium-4 small-12">
                    <h4>Bunny Tip</h4>
                    <p>If your bunny is biting you, respond how a rabbit would. Scream!</p>
                    <p>By shrieking or screaming immediately when they bite you, they will not only know they hurt you, but will be startled.</p>
                    <p>If the rabbit is trying to claim a piece of furniture or a spot in the house, scream then gently scoop them up and put them on the ground.</p>
                    <p class="red">Never hit, smack, or spank your bunny as punishment.</p>
                </aside>
                <p><strong>Little nips</strong> are often called 'love bites', and usually come with licking. A rabbit that licks and softly biting (without breaking the skin) is their way of grooming you. As highly social animals, rabbits often groom one another in the wild. A love bite is their way of trying to pull imaginary knots or clear sticky substances off of your 'fur'.</p>
                <p><strong>Chewing</strong> is often a sign of boredom, or nesting when on clothing. If they're out running around and chew on furniture, it is usually just your rabbit trying to wear down their teeth, much like a cat scratching on posts or the furniture to wear down their claws.</p>
                <p><strong>Threat biting</strong> can be actual nips in anger or dominance, such as trying to get you off of 'their' couch, or it can be a bearing of teeth to show how mad they are without actual biting. If you haven't done anything to incite anger or a show of dominance, you may want to check to see if your rabbit is frightened or in pain.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>Eyes</h3>
            <section class="medium-12 columns">
                <p><strong>Closed eyes</strong> especially during pettings or resting, means your rabbit is happy!</p>
                <p><strong>Bugged out eyes</strong> when the fur is spiked, the bunny is screaming or making <a href="#noises">noises</a> means fear or pain. If, however, your rabbit is sniffing the air curiously, has their ears up, or sees you approaching, they are excited. If your bunny has twitching ears and is sitting upright, those eyes mean your bunny is at it's most alert.</p>
                <p><strong>Protruding or visible eyelids with wide eyes</strong> indicates your bunny is uncomfortable or scared.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>Mouth</h3>
            <section class="medium-12 columns">
                <aside class="medium-4 columns">
                    <figure>
                        <div class="imageHolder">
                            <img src="media/images/yawning.jpg" alt="Just Yawning" />
                        </div>
                        <div class="imageHolder">
                            <img src="media/images/yawning2.jpg" alt="Just Yawning" />
                        </div>
                        <figcaption><p>Don't be scared, they're just yawning!</p></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </aside>
                <p><strong>Yawning</strong> is just like what you see in people, it means sleepiness or laziness. Even if the teeth are showing, the mouth is gaping wide enough that their faces are out of proportion, and they look quite scary... don't worry. It is still just a yawn.</p>
                <p><strong>Chin rubbing</strong> is a bunny's way of marking their belongings. Rabbits have scent glands in their chins. When your bunny rubs his/her chin on you, it's a good thing! It means your bunny has claimed you as their own.</p>
                <p><strong>Licking</strong> is the biggest sign of affection your rabbit can give. A bunny only grooms those they care about the most. While a bunny might lick you if you taste like their favorite food, most of the times it is a sign that they care about you. Licking can be prompted by lots of petting and cooing, and displays of affection on your part.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>Nose</h3>
            <section class="medium-12 columns">
                <p><strong>Nose bumping</strong> is a lot like sniffing, and can be their way of getting a really good sniff of you, or it can be a sign of affection. For some bunnies it can be a way to get your attention so they can get pettings.</p>
                <p><strong>Sniffing</strong> is a way for rabbits to sate their curiosity. If they can't stop sniffing you, it is because they smell another animal on you.</p>
                <p><strong>Loud sniffing</strong> can be a sign of exhaustion or anger. Bunnies often sniff loudly, rather than pant.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>Ears</h3>
            <p class="centerdescrip">Ear behaviors vary amongst lop-eared breeds.</p>
            <section class="medium-12 columns">
                <p><strong>Up and twitching</strong> ears are signs of an alert rabbit. If only one ear is up, your bunny is being lazy, trying to pay attention but not wanting to put a lot of effort into it.</p>
                <p><strong>Ears resting on their back</strong> are a sign of pleasure, <strong>if</strong> the ears are touching one another</p>
                <p><strong>Ears flattened against the head</strong> and not touching are a sign of fear. Usually this goes hand in hand with bugged eyes, thumping of feet, and bared teeth.</p>
                <p><strong>Pointing the ears up and back</strong> are from a bunny in a semi-relaxed position. They are ready to get up and roam soon, but are taking a breather in their daily adventures.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>Fur</h3>
            <section class="medium-12 columns">
                <p><strong>Puffed fur</strong> can be a sign of fear, or a way of keeping warm in cold weather. To tell the difference, check for bugged eyes, noises, or if the rabbit is overly alert.</p>
                <p><strong>Fur pulling</strong> on the rabbits own body usually happens with females to make a nest during pregnancy, and false pregnancy. If your bunny is pulling out other rabbit's fur, it is a sign of aggression.</p>

            <h2>Noises</h2>
            <section class="medium-12 columns">
                <p><strong>Wheezing</strong> constantly is a sure sign you need to go to the vet. Occasional wheezing sighs, especially if they're comfortable or just had a good play, are just a sign of sleepy happiness.</p>
                <p><strong>Screaming</strong> is a sure sign your rabbit is extremely frightened, in pain, or upset. Their screams sound just like a small child's, and are far louder than anyone would expect from such a small animal. If your rabbit screams check them immediately. If it is something that frightened them, stay beside them and comfort them for a few hours to make certain their panic doen't grow and lead to a heart attack. If they are in pain, they will likely need to go to a vet. If you can't find any obvious injuries, but they do not calm down after a few hours, go to the vet ASAP.</p>
                <p><strong>Purring</strong> can happen in bunnies too! Some do it much like a cat, while others 'tooth chirp' which is a method of purring by grinding their teeth. However they do it, this is always a sign that your bunny is happy.</p>
                <p><strong>Honking or whining</strong> sounds a lot like the noises a guinea pig or a dog makes. These are signs of irritation or annoyance. Some rabbits whine to get attention.</p>

                <aside class="medium-4 columns small-12 note">
                    <h4>Bunny Tip</h4>
                    <p>There are a lot of signs your bunny is irritated with you.</p>
                    <p>Foot flicks, pointedly turning their backs on you, and waiting to groom until you're watching them are a few.</p>
                    <p>Bunnies want you to notice that they are upset, so if you don't notice the first time, expect them to try again until they're certain you've gotten the point!</p>
                </aside>
                <p><strong>Head butting</strong> is a rabbit's method of moving things around. If your bunny headbutts your hand, they usually want more petting.</p>
                <p><strong>Throwing things</strong> by picking them up in their mouths and tossing them happens when bunnies are trying to organize their homes. This can include throwing hay around as well. Think of it as rearranging the furniture. Even when they tip over and toss food dishes, they are not rejecting food, just trying to put everything in the perfect place. You can always reorganize when the bunny is out of the cage or distracted, but they may move things again.</p>
                <p><strong>Head tossing</strong> or flicking the head to one side and back is known as a 'half-binky' and is a sign of happiness, though not as much as full binkies show.</p>
                <p><strong>Sitting up or standing on hind legs</strong> like a prairie dog shows that your bunny is curious. Many times they do that to guage if they can jump on top of something or not.</p>
                <p><strong>Washing themselves</strong> like a cat is perfectly normal. Sometimes when a bunny is irritated with someone, they will pointedly look at the subject of irritation, and once they know they are being watched, will start to wash themselves. This is a snub on their part.</p>
                <p><strong>Looking dead</strong>, as in stretching out fully, eyes open, and limp, is a good sign (as long as they aren't exhibiting symptoms of illness). It means your bunny is so relaxed they don't feel a need to be on alert for predators. This terrified me at first, as I was certain I had killed my bunny. Just look for signs of breathing, and once you see them, let them get their snooze on.</p>
                <p><strong>Flopping</strong> is another thing that frightened me. Your bunny will be playing, or sniffing around, then just drop onto their side as if they had fainted with their eyes open. Don't worry, they're just relaxing, and this is perfectly normal.</p>
                <p><strong>Kicking and scratching</strong> are signs of aggression or fear. This often happens when you try to pick your bunny up without proper support.</p>
                <p><strong>Foot-flicking</strong> is when your bunny kicks his/her feet back and out while hopping. This can e a sign of excitement, or disdain. Much like the gesture of a person brushing you off, a foot-flick can happen when they're irritated.</p>
                <p><strong>Stomping</strong> is strongly associated with fright, but can be a sign of annoyance, anger, or excitement. If a rabbit is thumping and looking afraid, try to stop whatever the source of their fear is, and comfort your bunny. Stomping in fear for too long could be a sign your bunny is having an anxiety attack, which could lead to a fear-induced heart attack.</p>
                <p><strong>Running and hopping fast</strong> are signs of playfullness and happiness. A rabbit with space to do it in will start tearing around their exercise space with quick turns, and jumps. If you see your rabbit running full speed away from something, check to see if it is in fear, or if it is a 'practice' run.</p>
                <p><strong>Circling the feet</strong> of a person, or running circles around another animal is a sign of bunny affection. In unneutered males, it can be followed by mounting.</p>
                <p><strong>Jumping or binkies</strong> are the biggest sign of happiness. I have to admit, the first couple of times I saw my rabbit binky, I thought my rabbit had a mental impairment. A binky is a high jump in the air with a twist of the body, ear flicking, and head flopping. It looks much like a siezure in mid jump. A binky in action is shown below. <br/> <span class="red">Warning: Loud music plays with video!</span></p>
