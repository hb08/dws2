                    <h4>Bunny Tip</h4>
                    <p>Bunnies are social animals. While any bunny home should include a place to feel safe (usually a covered corner or side will do), keeping the pen in an area where people usually are makes for the happiest house rabbits.</p>
                </aside>
                <p>Housing varies from owner to owner. Some prefer store bought <a href="#cages">cages</a>, while many owners are fans of the larger and more customizable <a href="#xpens">X-Pens</a> (aka Exercise Pens). Whether you make your own home for your bunny, or buy one, it is always important to <a href="#bunnyproof">bunny proof</a> your home for the times your rabbit gets the run of the room or house.</p>
                <p>By the very fact that you're looking at this site, I hope you are wanting an indoor rabbit. Outdoor hutches leave our bunny friends open to the weather, wily predators, and a lack of social interaction. Even the mere scent of a predator can cause a rabbit to have a panic attack, where they'll thrash and run wild inside their cage. At the very least this can cause them to injure themselves in their panic. At the worst, they can break their own backs or suffer a panic induced heart attack. Any bunny who has access to the ground will try to burrow, often times escaping their outdoor cages. Even if you don't lose your rabbit in an all bunny rendition of The Great Escape, they may end up snacking on a poisonous plant, as rabbits are extremely inquisitive, have no real instinctive knowledge of what plants can harm them, and even if the plant itself is not poisonous, pesticides and fertilizers on their paws or on their stolen snacks can kill them. Fleas, myxomatosis, and other diseases can easily be spread to outdoor rabbits.</p>
                <p>Below are a few options to house your new friend safely indoors.</p>
            </section>

        <h2>Cages and Pens</h2>
        <section class="medium-12 columns">
            <aside class="note medium-4 columns">
                <h4>Bunny Tip</h4>
                <p>Cages with front doors make it easiest for your bunny to get in and out on his/her own.</p>
                <p>Cages with top doors make it easier for pettings on the go, and to keep the more rambunctious rabbits inside while food and water is changed out.</p>
                <p>The very best cages will have both!</p>
            </aside>
                <p>Cages present the least favorite option of most bunny owners. Smaller in size than most bunnies enjoy, when keeping your bunny in a cage, it is best to let them out of the cage to roam a few hours every day. Fish tanks and glass aquariums should never be used. Not only are they rarely large enough, but they have very poor air circulation.</p>
                <p>The bigger the cage you can get, the better. Larger cages can be extremely expensive, but are well worth it if our rabbit is more comfortable on a daily basis. Each cage should be large enough to allow the bunny to move around, lie down, hold food, water, a litter box, and <a href="toys.html">toys</a>. A good cage sizing plan is to make certain the cage is at least 4-6 times the size of your bunny (when full grown) lying fully stretched out. For maximum bunny happiness, have 8 square feet of enclosure with at least 24 square feet for excersize space.</p>
                <p>Cages with wire bottoms can be easier to clean, but always include a platform of wood, tile, or carboard for your bunny to stand on. Constantly standing on wire, even the smaller mesh of most commercial cages, can damage the paws and cause a lot of discomfort for your furry friend.</p>
                <p>Some cages will come with multiple levels. Some rabbits love the chance to jump up and onto things, while others will prefer to use a ramp. Either way, for the safest multi-level home, ensure that the levels are not so high your bunny will hurt himself by jumping off an upper level. They are adventurous little animals, and will try it at least once. It's your job to make certain that even once is not one time too many.</p>

        <h2>X-Pens</h2>

                <h4>Bunny Tip</h4>
                <p>Worry about your bunny destroying the floor?</p>
                <p>Don't be! By placing carpeting (especially the rubber bottomed outdoor variety), tile, linoleum, or a wooden platform under the pen, your bunny can safely be destructive without causing a loss in a security deposit, or replacing your floor.</p>
            </aside>
            <p>Exercise Pens, or x-pens, are a favorite housing option for many owners. While cages limit a rabbits space and can cause frustration and behavior problems, an x-pen will keep your bunny safely contained and able to stretch his legs. Even rabbits who can jump high can be contained, with higher pen walls, wire tops, or even canvas stretched across the top.</p>
            <p>As with cages, the x-pen should always contain free hay, water, food, toys, and even a cottage.</p>
            <p>X-pens are usually created using exersize pens for larger animals, such as dogs. They can be configured into any shape you like, are easy to clean, and are very portable.</p>
            <p>Popular heights for the pens are 24" for non-jumping rabbits, 30-36" for the more vertically adventurous ones. It can be best to go with a higher pen wall with a new bunny to make certain you won't have an escapee.</p>
            <p>If you rabbit is prone to chewing, avoid painted metal. Swallowing paint is just as bad for bunnies as it is for people.</p>
            <p>X-pens can be bought at most pet stores, rabbit rescues, or online (through Amazon, E-bay, etc).</p>

        <h2>Bunny Proofing</h2>
        <p>Bunny proofing your home is a very important part of having a house rabbit. Not only does it prevent destruction of your property, but it will protect your rabbit from harm.</p>
        <h3>Electrical Cords</h3>
        <section class="medium-12 columns">
            <aside class="note medium-4 columns">
                <h4>Bunny Tip</h4>
                <p>Bunny proofing is a lot like baby proofing a home.</p>
                <p>The easiest way to see what your rabbit will get into is to get down on their level. Laying down on the ground lets you see the world from their point of view, and can give you a glimpse of hazards you wouldn't normally see.</p>
            </aside>

            <p>Electrical cords present the most danger to the house rabbit. One nip into a live electrical wire can burn, electrocute, or kill your bunny outright. Training alone is not a sure-fire method to keep your bunny safe. One moment of mischief can result in a whole lot of grief.</p>
            <p>Preventing electrical dangers can be done in several easy ways.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spiral cable wraps, found at any electronics store and many grocery stores can be bought for a couple of bucks. They are flexible enough to work well with cords that are moved often, like video game, phone, and lamp cords. While some bunnies can chew through them, many will not.</li>
                    <li>Plastic tubing, like those used with fish tanks or swamp coolers, can be bought at hardware or aquarium stores. If you slit them length wise, cords can be tucked inside. Some plastic tubing even comes pre-slit.</li>
                    <li>Decorative wire-concealers that stick to the base of walls and go into corners are an excellent and well hidden method. While this is far more time consuming, it is also far more permanent of an option.</li>
                    <li>Running cables and wires behind or above furniture costs nothing, but can be risky. Rabbits love to explore small dark spaces, and they love to climb. Cords that may be safely tucked above your furniture or behind it could be reached by a particularly enterprising rabbit.</li>
                    <li class="red">Never run your wires under carpet. This can create a serious fire risk, even without your bunny's help.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>
        <h3>Houseplants</h3>
        <section class="medium-12 columns">
            <p>Most houseplants are deadly to your rabbit. Putting them up high may not be prevention enough for an ambitious rabbit. Hanging them from the ceiling can certainly help, but be on the lookout for leaves or flowers that fall off.</p>
            <p>If you want to know if your houseplants are secret killers, several great lists can be found in the <a href="links.html">links</a> portion of the site. </p>
        </section>
        <h3>Furniture and Baseboards</h3>
        <section class="medium-12 columns">
            <p>Some rabbits are big on chewing. For these bunnies, baseboards, wooden furniture, and even wooden knick-knacks can become targets. Boards can be placed around furniture and decorations, providing an edible distraction.</p>
            <p>Proper training and 'safe' chew toys can be an effective means of keeping your belongings and bunny safe.</p>
        </section>
        <h3>Walls</h3>
        <section class="medium-12 columns">
            <p>Some rabbits like to chew on or scratch up walls. To keep your walls safe, clear plastic panels bought from a hardware or plastic supply store can be used like wainscoating. Placing furniture in front of their favorite places can also hinder them successfully.</p>
        </section>
        <h3>Hidey-Holes</h3>
        <section class="medium-12 columns">
        <aside class="medium-4 columns note">
            <h4>Bunny Tip</h4>
            <p>Providing wood and cardboard for your bunny to chew on could curb their destructive desires.</p>
            <p>Avoid treated or painted wood, cardboard with glue, staples, or tape. These can all be posinous to your bunny.</p>
        </aside>
            <p>Bunnies love to find small dark places to explore and nap in. This can be especially frustrating if they get under a bed or upholstered furniture and burrow their way inside. An easy method to prevent this is to create 'bunny bumpers'. By using 2x4s, you can easily create frames around the base to keep them out. Some owners even create frames to go beneath the furniture, just inside the legs to create an invisible (from human eye level) barrier. Be certain to check your barriers on a regular basis, as rabbits are likely to chew on exposed corners or edges, and could gnaw a hole big enough to get underneath. A good guideline, when bunny-proofing against these hide aways, is to block up any space that is as large as your rabbit's head. They're naturally inclined to find small spaces, and will use entrances even smaller than what you might first think is possible.</p>
